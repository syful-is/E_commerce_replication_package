## abstract:
Selecting an e-commerce platform is a very crucial task when opening an online store.
Diversity of technology stacks has led to dozens of e-commerce platforms with a variety of features. 
While previous studies have shown that developers struggle with various issues during the development of an online business store. 
In this study, we explore 19 e-commerce platforms to understand whether their features correlate with the experience of developers. 
By analyzing the questions that developers ask on the question-and-answer site Stack Overflow, we find that developers ask questions on 17 e-commerce website development related issues that can be grouped into 5 major themes (i.e., database management, payment options, sales features, website design features, and website errors). 
In addition, our analyses also indicate that the technology stack of e-commerce platforms correlates with the development and maintenance experience of an online store by developers.
